### Stopwatch app using Java
This basic stopwatch app in Java features a TextView displaying the elapsed time and includes three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset. The Start button activates the stopwatch, beginning the time count immediately. The Stop button halts the stopwatch, displaying the total elapsed time from activation to deactivation. The Reset button stops the stopwatch if running and resets the time to 00:00:00, preparing the app for a new timing session.
